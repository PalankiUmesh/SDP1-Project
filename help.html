    <h2>What is bidding?</h2>
    <p>
      Bidding is an offer to set a price tag by an individual or business for a
      product or service or a demand that something be done. Bidding is used to
      determine the cost or value of some products. Online Bidding means an
      electronic procurement process in which agencies receive bids from vendors
      for goods, services, or construction documents over the Internet or an web
      application.
